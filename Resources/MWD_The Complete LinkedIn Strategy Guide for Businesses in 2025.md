\#\#\# Algorithm Evolution in 2025

LinkedIn implemented significant algorithm changes throughout 2025 that fundamentally altered content performance:

\#\# Content Strategy & Performance Optimization

Based on analysis of 1 million posts, content performance hierarchy has crystallized\[7\]:

1\. \*\*Multi-Image Posts: 6.60% engagement rate\*\* \- Visual storytelling showcasing company culture and events  
2\. \*\*Native Documents: 6.10% engagement rate\*\* \- Perfect for breaking down complex insights and frameworks    
3\. \*\*Video Posts: 5.60% engagement rate\*\* \- Native videos under 90 seconds perform best  
4\. \*\*Image Posts: 4.85% engagement rate\*\* \- Still reliable but less attention-grabbing

\#\#\# Engagement Tactics That Work

\*\*Comment Strategy:\*\*  
\- \*\*Comments with 10+ words boost reach by 2x\*\*\[6\]
